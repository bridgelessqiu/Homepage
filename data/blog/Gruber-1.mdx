**Microeconomics**: The study of how individuals and firms make decisions in a world of <u>scarcity</u>. 

1. It is a series of *constrained optimization* exercises - Agents (individuals and firms) operate under a set of constraints to optimization their objectives.

2. *Tradeoffs and opportunity cost* - Anything an agent does, it could have done something else instead (with an alternative gain).

### A simple model of supply and demand

1. Two linear curves.

2. As the price increases, supply goes up and demand goes down. 

3. The two curves meet at the **market equilibrium**, where both consumers and producers are happy to make a transactions (at the market clearing price). 

### The supply and demand scissors

Supply goes hand in hand with demand, they cannot be treated in isolation. 

**An example**: water vs diamonds. Water (being the essence of life) has a much higher demand than diamonds. Nevertheless, water is much 'cheaper' than diamonds due to the differences in their supply. That is, water is often thought of 'unlimited'; clearly not the case of diamonds.

### Positive vs normative analysis 

Positive analysis are descriptive and factual statement about an economic phenomenon (e.g., why something happened?). Normative analysis cares about the underlying values and morals of a phenomenon (e.g., should something happen?). 

**An example**: eBay kidney auction. In 1999, someone was trying to sell a kidney using eBay auction. The price went from \$$25,000$ to \$$5.7$ million within one week. [Further reading](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebay-halts-kidney-auction/)

1. Positive analysis - The price is high because of low supply and high demand.

2. Normative analysis - Should such transactions be permitted? The answer might be no due to factors such as $(i)$ market failure (e.g., fraud, imperfect information), $(ii)$ equity / fairness (e.g., favorable to rich).
