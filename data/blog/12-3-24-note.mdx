## First Talk 
[Market Algorithms for Autobidding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl-b94rk-84&t=244s&ab_channel=SimonsInstitute) by Gagan Aggarwal - Google Research

**Background**: After a user query, a collection of relevant ads are selected. An auction then determines which ads to show (to an user). 

1. Advertisers are **buyers**.

2. **Items** to sell can be:

    a. Slots (where ads are displayed) on a website. 

    b. Advertisers often bid on keywords, and participate in multiple auctions with queries for the relevant keywords.

3. Company (e.g., Google, Meta) are sellers. 

The common auction for selling a single item is the *second price auction*. 


### Auto-bidding

Instead of submitting the exact bids, advertisers provides *goals* (e.g., maximizing utility, value, number of conversions) and *constraints* (e.g., budget, ROI) to an automated system. The system then sets the bids on advertisers' behalf in auctions, aiming to achieve the goal (i.e., optimize objectives) s.t. the constraints. 

#### Question I: Bidding Algorithms

**One example bidding algorithm** is discussed on page 5 - 6 in the survey paper by [Aggarwal et al.' 24'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07685), with a more detailed explanation in this 2019 paper by [ABM' 19](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35389-6_2). Here, the optimal bid for an agent in auction $j$ is of the form:

$$
b_j = \frac{v_j + \sum_c \alpha_c w_j^c}{\lambda + \sum_c \alpha_c}
$$

obtain from the dual program. The highlight is that, $(i)$ in a truthful auction (e.g., second-price) where $(ii)$ the prices of items are known (and fixed), by bidding the above amount, an agent gets the items that optimize its objective. 

The above results is for the scenario where only one advertiser uses an auto-bidding system, where other submit their fixed bids. 

#### Question II: Equilibria

**When everyone uses autobidding - Dynamics and Equilibrium.** Some work on this: [APZ' 23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3580507.3597707), [ABM' 19](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35389-6_2).


#### Question III: Auction design

This is from an auctioneer's perspective. Many factors to consider(e.g., reserve price, multi-channel design). This issue is more complicated when buyers are value-maximizing.  

This multi-channel auction design is very interesting.
