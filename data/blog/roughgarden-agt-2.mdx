### Simple single-item sealed-bid first/second-price auctions

1. There is a single item for sale.

2. Each bidder $i$ has a private valuation $v_i$ for the item.
    - The valuation is the maximum amount of money that $i$ is willing to pay for the item.

3. Each bidder has a quasilinear utility function:
    - If $i$ wins, $u_i = v_i - p_i$;$p_i$ is the price that bidder $i$ pays. 
    - If $i$ does not win, $u_i = 0$.

4. The bids are submitted privately to the auctioneer, who then determines the winner and the price. 

5. The auction can be first-price or second-price.

In first-price auctions, one does not want to bids its true valuation, as it always results in a zero utility. Instead, the bid amount depends on others' bids. On the other hand, in the second-price auction, the (weakly) dominant strategy for a players is to simply bid its true valuation.

**Claim 1.** In a seal-bid second-price auction, bidding the valuation is a dominant strategy.

<div style={{borderLeft: "1px solid white", padding: "10px"}}>
**Proof sketch.**
Fix a player $i$ and $b_{-i}$; let $b^*$ be the maximum of $b_{-i}$. If $v_i < b^*$, then bidding $v_i$ results in a zero utility (as $i$ loses). Nevertheless, any other bid that results in $i$ winning implies a payment of $b^* > v_i$, and thus a negative utility.

If $v_i \geq b^*$, then bidding $v_i$ results in a utility of $v_i - b^*$ which is at least as good as not winning.

</div>

One can also observe that truth telling in a second-price auction never gives a negative utility, regardless of the bids of others. 

Overall, second-price auctions have the following desirable properties:

1. <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#5A7D5A", color: "black", padding: "2px 6px", borderRadius: "4px", boxShadow: "1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)"}}>dominant-strategy incentive-compatible(DSIC)</span> - 
telling the truth is a dominant strategy for all players (and the utility is always non-negative).

2. Can be implemented efficiently. 

3. If bidders are truthful, then the auction maximizes the valuation of the outcome (social surplus).

#### Remark 

Note that in a standard second-price auction, the second-highest bid equals to the highest bid if there is a tie. However, if we change the rule to paying the second-highest bid that is **strictly less** than the highest bid (for now, lets assume there are always at least two distinct bids), then bidding own valuation is no longer a dominant strategy, as overbidding sometimes helps. 

For instance, fix $i$, and suppose $v_i$ lies between $b^*$ and $b'$, where $b'$ is the second-highest bid in $b_{-i}$ that is strictly less than $b^*$. Then, bidding $b^*$ gives a non-zero expected utility for $i$ (randomness comes from tie breaking).

See page $5$ of the [lecture note](https://timroughgarden.org/f13/l/l2.pdf) for an example of ads auctions. 

> Step 1: Assume, without justification, that bidders bid truthfully. Then, how should we assign bidders to slots so that the above properties (2) and (3) hold? Step 2: Given our answer to Step 1, how should we set selling prices so that the above property (1) holds?
