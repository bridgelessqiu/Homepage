**The demand curve**: A model of *utility maximization*

1. Preferences - how to model people's tastes 

2. Budget constraints (next lecture)

### Preference assumptions

1. **Completeness**: An agent has Preference over any set of goods it might choose from; it can always rank them (with possibly ties). An agent can indeed be indifferent, but it cannot say "I don't know which one do I prefer.".

2. **Transitivity**.  

3. **Non-satiation**: An agent always prefer more of a good over less.
