**Disclaimer**: Proofs are not of their most formal forms. The notation $0$ could refer to either a scalar or the zero vector.

## Exercise 1A

### Problems 1 - 5

Simple derivations.

### Problem 6
*Show that for every $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$, there exists a unique $\beta \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\alpha \beta = 1$*.

**Proof.** W.l.o.g., assume that $\alpha = a + bi \neq 0$, as $0$ has no multiplicative inverse. We first show the uniqueness of an inverse, assuming its existence. Suppose

$$
(a + bi)(c + di) = 1 = (a + bi)(e + fi)
$$

It follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
(c + di)
 &= (c + di) (a + bi) (e + fi)\\
 &= 1 \cdot (e + fi) \\
 &= (e + fi)
\end{align*}
$$

To prove the existence of an inverse, one can verify that, with
$$
c = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}, \;\; d = -\frac{b}{a^2 + b^2}
$$
we have $(a + bi) (c + di) = 1$. Since $a + bi \neq 0 \Rightarrow a^2 + b^2 \neq 0$, thus $\beta = c + di$ exists. This concludes the proof.


### Problem 7

*Show that $(-1 + \sqrt{3}i)/2$ is a cube root of $1$.*

**Ans.** Either via a direct calculation, or the fact that $1$ has three cube roots: $e^{(\pi/3) \cdot (2k+1)}$, $k = 0, 1, 2$. 

### Problem 8

*Find two distinct square roots of $i$*.

**Ans.** $e^{\pi/4 \cdot i}$ and $e^{{5\pi/4 \cdot i}}$.

### Remaining Problems

Calculations and derivations. 

## Exercise 1B

### Problem 1

*Prove that $-(-v) = v$ for every $v \in V$.*

**Ans.** The additive inverse is unique.

### Problem 2
*Suppose $a \in \mathbb{F}$, $v \in V$, and $av = 0$. Prove $a = 0$ or $v = 0$.*

**Proof.** If $a = 0$, then $av = 0$. Suppose $a \neq 0$, then there exists $a^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}$ s.t. $a^{-1} a= 1$. Then 

$$
\begin{align*}
v = 1 \cdot v 
  = a^{-1} a \cdot v
  = a^{-1} 0
  = 0
\end{align*}
$$
This concludes the proof.

### Problem 3
Derivations.

### Problem 4
*Why the empty set is not a vector space.*

**Ans.** An additive identity must exist in a vector space.
