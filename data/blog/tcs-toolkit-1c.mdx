### Some useful resources

1. [The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/)

2. [Inverse Symbolic Calculator](https://thomasahle.com/ries/?T=1.618033) (super useful)

    Note that the first site shown on Google is permanently down. There is also a version [here](https://mrob.com/pub/ries/index.html) that one and build and run on your local machine (it is quite impressive that this program consists of $12,000+$ lines of code, all inside a single file).

3. Mathematica (super useful)

    Do any derivation, integration, expansion etc.

### A working example 

The example given by Prof. O'Donnell was quite eye-opening for me when I was first time watching it: [link](https://youtu.be/qP4XEZ54eSc?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX&t=655).
